    MICROSERVICES - EXAMPLE
</h1>

## What is a microservice ?
#### It is a small service, which has very little responsibility, within a context that is normally large, which is our solution. The great advantage of microservices is that these systems each play their part, communicating with each other, to generate a final result. Each microservice has its own infrastructure and its own database, so each micro has to work independently.
